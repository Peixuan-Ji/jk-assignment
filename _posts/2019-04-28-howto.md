I am a photographer, these pictures are taken when traveling, 6 photos of the main location in St. Petersburg, with friends from Urumqi, Xinjiang, all the way to travel by car, traveling in the train for 7 days Reach the destination, passing many landscapes along the way. Like to shoot some buildings, humanities, through the charm of light and shadow, the ordinary life more art is presented in a simple photo. Time flies, only the memory of the grid forever.
